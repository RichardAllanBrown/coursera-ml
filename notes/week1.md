#Week 1
##Introduction
###Welcome
 - Learning algorithms used everywhere, Google, Facebook et al.
 - Long way to strong AI, but ML is a step on the path
 - Big in data mining, unprogrammable problems, customizations, real AI
 - Highly sought after skillset

###What is ML
 - Giving compiters ability to learn without explicit programming
 - Checkers playing program that played better than the programmer (Arthur Samuel)
 - "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." - Tom Mitchell
 - Can classify broadly as Supervised or Unsupervised (Reinforcement and Recommenders are less common)

###Supervised Learning
 - Always have a data set of inputs (features) and correct outputs
 - Can be classed as either regression (continuous output e.g. number of sales) or classification type problems (hacked or not)
 - Using an example of predicting house prices against the area of it.
   - Right answers (i.e. training data) provided
   - Straight or quadratic fit
   - Continuous function makes it a regression problem
 - Breast Cancer example (size vs. malignancy)
   - Taking data of tumor size vs. malignancy
   - Outputs a discrete value of 0 (no cancer) or 1 (cancer)
   - Example of a classification problem
   - Might have more inputs (features), such as tumor size and age
   - Infinite number of features would help to make a more accurate model (and it is possible!)
 - Other regression example might be how much of a product you could sell over 3 months
 - Other classification example, deciding for each customer account if it has been hacked or not
 
###Unsupervised Learning
 - When we have no idea what results may look like
 - e.g. Group millions of genes into groups that correcate to lifespan, location etc.
 - Say, group news articles into categories on the same story
 - Take customer data and find market segments
 - When we don't have answers, we are unsupervised
 - Clustering algorithms that attempt to segment a data set
 - Social net analysis, market segmentation, astronomy
 - (Cocktail party)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect] algorithm
   - 2 microphones recording 2 speakers
   - Can split the voices into 2 seperate recordings!
   - Applications - remove music from background noise
 - Octave is foss useful for dealing with ML (provides a higher level interface)
 - Usually prototype in Octave to get something good, then move over to java/C to program production code
